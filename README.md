# Simulated Global Keylogger Demonstration

This project demonstrates a simulated global keylogger using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It captures keystrokes typed anywhere on the page and displays them in different formats (character, hexadecimal, and binary).

## Features

- Captures keystrokes typed anywhere on the page.
- Displays captured keystrokes in character, hexadecimal, and binary formats.
- Simulated keyboard interface to visualize key presses.
- Clear button to reset the captured keystrokes.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Start typing anywhere on the page to see the captured keystrokes.
3. Use the simulated keyboard interface to visualize key presses.
4. Click the "Clear" button to reset the captured keystrokes.

## Note

This project is a simulation and does not use the HID (Human Interface Device) protocol. It is intended for demonstration purposes only and does not capture keystrokes at the system level.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for handling keystroke logging and keyboard interface interactions.
